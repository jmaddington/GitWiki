## What is GitWiki?

GitWiki is a wiki system that:
- Uses Git as the versioning backend for full history tracking
- Provides a web-based markdown editor with WYSIWYG preview
- Supports clipboard image paste for easy screenshot inclusion
- Handles merge conflicts with an intuitive resolution interface
- Synchronizes with GitHub for distributed collaboration
- Generates static files for fast read performance
- Supports draft/publish workflow to separate work-in-progress from published content

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Planned Features
- **Web-based editing**: Edit markdown pages through an intuitive web interface
- **Clipboard image support**: Paste screenshots directly into pages
- **Git versioning**: Full history tracking with commit messages
- **Conflict resolution**: Visual merge conflict resolution with Monaco Editor
- **GitHub sync**: Bidirectional synchronization with GitHub repositories
- **Draft/publish workflow**: Work on drafts before publishing to main
- **Static generation**: Fast page loading via pre-generated static HTML
- **Flexible permissions**: Open, read-only public, or private modes
- **Image support**: PNG, WebP, and JPG images with automatic optimization

### üöÄ Post-MVP Features
- Mermaid diagram support
- Full-text search
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Email notifications
- Export to PDF/static site
- Mobile optimization

## Architecture

GitWiki is built with Django and consists of three main apps:

1. **Git Service**: Handles all repository operations, static file generation, and GitHub sync
2. **Editor Service**: Provides the markdown editing interface and image upload handling
3. **Display Service**: Serves static content with optional API enhancements

Each app maintains 95%+ separation of concerns and could be extracted into separate services if needed.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python), GitPython, Celery, Redis
- **Frontend**: SimpleMDE/Monaco Editor, JavaScript Clipboard API
- **Infrastructure**: Git, GitHub, Gunicorn, Nginx
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
