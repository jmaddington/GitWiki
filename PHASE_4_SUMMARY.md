# Phase 4 Implementation Summary - Conflict Resolution

**Completed:** October 25, 2025
**Branch:** `claude/review-project-docs-011CUUeDLGKqsmPynJueiBJm`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 4 successfully implements a complete conflict resolution system with Monaco Editor for three-way diff, handling text, image, and binary file conflicts. The system includes backend detection, API endpoints, UI views, and comprehensive templates for conflict resolution workflows.

**Key Achievement:** From conflict detection (HTTP 409) to full resolution capability with Monaco Editor integration.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend Methods (git_operations.py - +297 lines)

**File Size:** 851 → 1,148 lines

**Three Core Methods:**

#### `get_conflicts()` (lines 836-925)
- Lists all draft branches with merge conflicts
- 2-minute caching via Django cache framework
- Extracts user_id from branch name (draft-{user_id}-{uuid})
- Returns structured conflict data with timestamps
- Cache hit/miss logging

**Features:**
- Expensive operation cached appropriately
- Handles missing branches gracefully
- Returns empty list when no conflicts
- Includes cached status in response

#### `get_conflict_versions()` (lines 927-991)
- Extracts three-way diff (base, theirs, ours)
- Uses Git merge-base to find common ancestor
- Handles missing files (returns empty strings)
- Returns content for Monaco Editor

**Algorithm:**
```python
1. Get merge base (common ancestor) between main and draft
2. Extract file content from base commit
3. Extract file content from main (theirs)
4. Extract file content from draft (ours)
5. Return all three versions
```

#### `resolve_conflict()` (lines 993-1131)
- Applies conflict resolution to draft branch
- Commits resolution with special message
- Automatically retries publish_draft()
- Supports both text and binary files
- Returns merge status + remaining conflicts

**Workflow:**
```
1. Validate branch exists
2. Checkout draft branch
3. Write resolved content
4. Commit resolution
5. Retry publish_draft()
6. Return success or partial resolution
```

**Grepable Codes Added:** 14 codes
- GITOPS-CONFLICT02 through GITOPS-CONFLICT09 (8 codes)
- GITOPS-RESOLVE01 through GITOPS-RESOLVE05 (5 codes)

**AIDEV-NOTEs Added:** 3 anchors
- `conflict-detection` (line 840)
- `three-way-diff` (line 931)
- `conflict-resolution` (line 1004)

    "ours": "content from draft branch",
    "file_path": "docs/page.md",
    "branch_name": "draft-123-abc"
}
```

**Features:**

    "resolution_content": "resolved content...",
    "conflict_type": "text"  // or "image_mine", "image_theirs", "binary_mine", "binary_theirs"
}
Response: {
    "success": true,
    "merged": true,
    "message": "Conflict resolved and changes published",

## Architecture Review

### ✅ Excellent Decisions

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - 2-minute cache on get_conflicts()
   - Prevents performance issues
   - Cache status returned to client

2. **Three-Way Diff Algorithm**
   - Uses Git merge-base (correct algorithm)
   - Handles missing files gracefully
   - Returns structured data

3. **Automatic Merge Retry**
   - resolve_conflict() retries publish_draft()
   - Handles partial resolutions
   - Returns remaining conflicts

4. **Monaco Editor Integration**
   - Via CDN (no build process)
   - Side-by-side diff mode
   - Manual edit fallback

5. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Git Service: pure data operations
   - API: request/response handling
   - Views: routing and template selection
   - Templates: presentation and user interaction

6. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - 6 unit tests cover main scenarios
   - Success and error paths
   - Edge cases handled

### 🎯 Alignment with Project Standards

- ✅ **95%+ app separation** maintained
- ✅ **Atomic operations** preserved
- ✅ **Unique grepable codes** for all logs
- ✅ **AIDEV-NOTEs** for AI navigation
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling**
- ✅ **Django best practices** followed

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Cache Invalidation**
   - 2-minute TTL is fixed
   - Could make configurable via Configuration model

2. **Binary File Handling**
   - Simple "mine vs theirs" choice
   - No preview for non-image binaries
   - Consider adding file type detection

3. **Monaco Editor CDN**
   - Requires internet connection
   - Could add local fallback
   - Version pinned to 0.44.0

4. **No Conflict Notifications**
   - Users must check dashboard
   - Could add email/webhook notifications
   - Consider adding conflict age indicators

5. **Limited Multi-File Conflict UI**
   - Currently resolves one file at a time
   - Could add batch resolution UI
   - Consider multi-file diff view

---

## Future Enhancements

**Phase 4.1 (Optional):**
- [ ] Conflict notifications via email/webhook
- [ ] Conflict age indicators ("3 hours old")
- [ ] Auto-cleanup of resolved conflicts
- [ ] Batch conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Multi-file diff view

**Phase 4.2 (Post-MVP):**
- [ ] Real-time conflict detection (WebSocket)
- [ ] Conflict history and analytics
- [ ] Advanced merge strategies
- [ ] Team conflict resolution (voting)

---

## Phase 5 Preparation

Phase 4 is now complete. The next phase (GitHub Integration) can proceed:

**Phase 5 Requirements:**
- ✅ Conflict detection working
